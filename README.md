A medium sized FFT butterfly RTL design was achieved using System Verilog. The hardware program was implemented on an Altera FPGA development system. The design generated from high-level synthesis and included controller and data path. The design supported two 8-bit signed input through and one user-defined coefficient of FFT butterfly using a simple hand-shaking protocol.
